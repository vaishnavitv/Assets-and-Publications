Burnaby is home to Simon Fraser University (SFU), a renowned institution known for its strong computer science and engineering programs. The presence of SFU contributes to a flow of fresh talent and fosters a culture of research and innovation in the technical field.
Burnaby houses several technology companies, ranging from established multinational corporations  (Electronic Arts for instance where I am a full stack engineer currently) to innovative startups. These companies often attract skilled developers and engineers, creating a pool of talent within the city.

The developer community in Burnaby actively participates in various meetups, conferences, and events related to software development, web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and other tech-related domains. These gatherings offer excellent networking opportunities and a chance to learn from industry experts.

GDG offers a platform to build a local community of like-minded developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts. It fosters networking and collaboration opportunities.
It is also a forum where members can share knowledge, experiences, and best practices related to Google technologies. This sharing of information can help others learn and grow in their skills.

GDG will help me host events like workshops, tech talks, hackathons, and study jams. These events offer valuable learning opportunities for attendees to enhance their technical expertise.

Bonus : Being an official GDG often comes with perks such as access to Google resources, potential collaboration opportunities, and visibility within the tech community.
