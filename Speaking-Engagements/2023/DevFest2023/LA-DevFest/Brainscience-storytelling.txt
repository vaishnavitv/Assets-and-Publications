A great technique in storytelling is to show rather than tell to your audience what a character may be feeling or experiencing. By telling, you simply inform the reader, presenting them with factual statements, while by showing, a more intimate connection is being created. A mental model of the scene and the emotions that the characters are feeling, instead of simply stating information.

“Don’t tell me the moon is shining. Show me the glint of light on broken glass.”
― Anton Checkhov

In programming, there is a similar principle that is known as Tell, Don’t Ask that aims to control coupling between classes. As a good storyteller is expected to show to the audience instead of directing telling them information, a software developer can also tell (command) its objects to behave as expected instead of querying them for their internal state.
