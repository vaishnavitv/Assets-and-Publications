Color as Context
Never rely exclusively on color to provide information, make a comparison, or to illicit a response. Blind or color blind users will likely not be able to use this information. Although color can be used in your documents you should also use text-based methods to convey information, instead of relying solely on color.

Using image descriptions (sometimes called “alt text”) helps make sure that everyone can extract meaning from the images in your README file. People with low vision who use a screenreader access the image description to understand the context of the image that is displayed.

Think of alt text like a tweet: be succinct, concise and descriptive.
