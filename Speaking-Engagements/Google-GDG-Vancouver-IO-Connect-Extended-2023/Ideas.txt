ZeroEyes was founded in 2018 by former Navy SEALs, Special Operations military veterans, and technologists. 

The company develops AI gun detection and situational awareness technology to prevent mass shootings and gun-related violence. The software integrates into existing digital security cameras and sends alerts when the gun is verified and detected within 3-5 seconds.

ZeroEye’s primary market and goal were to prevent school mass shootings. Due to the pandemic, while everybody was studying from home, the company temporarily pivoted to other target audiences such as retail locations, corporate campuses, government campuses, malls, and casinos. That move allowed them to expand the customer base and raise new investments in 2022 for its scaling.
