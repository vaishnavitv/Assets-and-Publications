Talk-driven development : Teaching can be a superpower in software engineering


"Engaging in 'Talk-Driven Development' involves dedicating oneself to articulating thoughts on a specific subject, a practice that often leads developers to discover new insights while delving into the realms of cutting-edge technologies in anticipation of a presentation.

Beyond its immediate relevance to software development, teaching possesses transformative powers that extend into various domains. Extensive research supports the existence of the Protégé Effect, a psychological phenomenon wherein individuals who teach or prepare to teach others attain a profound understanding of the material at hand.

Consistently sharing insights with a community not only fosters personal growth but also deepens one's technical expertise. Simultaneously, it hones communication skills, enabling the effective elucidation of novel concepts to others.

In my public sharing endeavors, I aim to spotlight those 'aha' moments or lightbulb realizations where the knowledge gained becomes something I fervently wish I had known earlier."
A study published in Memory & Cognition in 2014 determined that just the expectation that one will need to teach can enhance one’s learning and organization of knowledge.

How to Increase Your Luck Surface Area
"Luck Surface Area" is a turn of phrase that popped out my mouth during a discussion episode of TechZing a few months back and is something I've been meaning to write about ever since but never got around to actually doing. However, thanks to Lance Jones who referenced the concept in a recent blog post I have finally been spurred into action.


The protégé effect is a concept in learning that suggests we learn more effectively by teaching information to others, even if those others aren’t necessarily any less knowledgeable. As author Robert Heinlein puts it, ‘when one teaches, two learn’.
