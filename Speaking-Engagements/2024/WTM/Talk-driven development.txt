Talk-driven development : Teaching can be a superpower in software engineering

"Talk-driven development" informally means committing to speaking on a particular topic can lead to a developer learning something new in the process of experimenting with new technologies in preparation for a presentation.  

“To teach is to learn twice.” — Joseph Joubert

Teaching brings superpowers that span beyond software development.  Numerous studies have shown a psychological phenomena, known as the Protégé Effect, in which learners who teach or prepare to teach others gain a deeper understanding of the material in the process.


 The objective of teaching as a learning strategy is that regardless of where someone is in their learning process, they can benefit from teaching others by publicly documenting some of their learnings and taking a documentation-driven approach to accelerating their learning and growth. A key component of documentation-driven growth is taking advantage of the protégé effect by learning in anticipation that you will be sharing some of your learnings and decisions with others.




"Engaging in 'Talk-Driven Development' involves dedicating oneself to articulating thoughts on a specific subject, a practice that often leads developers to discover new insights while delving into the realms of cutting-edge technologies in anticipation of a presentation.

Beyond its immediate relevance to software development, teaching possesses transformative powers that extend into various domains. Extensive research supports the existence of the Protégé Effect, a psychological phenomenon wherein individuals who teach or prepare to teach others attain a profound understanding of the material at hand.

Consistently sharing insights with a community not only fosters personal growth but also deepens one's technical expertise. Simultaneously, it hones communication skills, enabling the effective elucidation of novel concepts to others.

In my public sharing endeavors, I aim to spotlight those 'aha' moments or lightbulb realizations where the knowledge gained becomes something I fervently wish I had known earlier."
