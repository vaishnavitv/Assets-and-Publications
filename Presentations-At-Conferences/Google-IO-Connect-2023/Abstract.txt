Visual communication is the practice of using visual elements to get a message across, inspire change, or evoke an emotion.

Visual Communication exists in two parts; communication design and graphic design:

Communication design refers to crafting a message that educates, motivates, and engages the viewer.
Graphic design uses design principles to communicate that message in a way that is clear and eye-catching to the intended audience.
Humans are visually oriented animals with approximately 55% of our cortex is dedicated to processing visual stimuli.

With more than half of our higher processing power dedicated to parsing out what we see, it would only make sense that technical communicators would be concerned with the look of their deliverables, and why the use of photos, videos, and infographics continues to rise in technical communication. Visuals are a great way to storytelling and can break geographical boundaries and reduce misunderstandings. It also helps in information retention and sparks creativity. When harnessed with the right colors to call for attention and highlight important events.

However, not everyone is a graphic designer, an artist or has access to high end tools. My talk will show you various ways to create and capture software engineering and technical concepts using available tools and techniques.

Visualization helps in getting quick feedback and shows the impact of work by using data visualization and helps process information effectively.

The part of the brain that processes visual information (the visual cortex) is much larger than the part of the brain responsible for reading words (the broca). By providing your information in a visual presentation, you make it much easier on your team to process the information effectively.
