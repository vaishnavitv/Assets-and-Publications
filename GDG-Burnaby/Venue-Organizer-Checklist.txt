I finished a call with Director of events of a university and these are some of the questions I asked when scouting for a venue. 
•	Is the sponsor's mission and vision is inline with GDG
•	Personal Injury on site and how does the insurance work (wire tripping/slipping off the stairs/tumbleweed situation)
•	What happens if anything accidentally breaks (projector or other device) during the event
•	Kids and baby policy - if we can hire an agency and have a space dedicated to welcome parents bring kids
•	Breastfeeding room or space if above point applies (we will ask for a accommodations as part of ticket purchase)
•	Wheelchair and Accessibility
•	Promotion & Advertising Alcohol policy for socials (after the event) - Is wine an option
•	Sponsorship from other companies/competitors
•	Maximum headcount for safety reasons apart from GDG count including venue staff, photographers and coordinators
•	Do we have a dedicated tech support person on the day
•	Promotion & Restrictions on Advertising
•	Gender Neutral washrooms availability
•	Conflict of Interest with other Universities admission program
•	If a University is providing the venue and if the event is Ticketed do the campus expect any payment going to them
•	Fire safety and evacuation, some basic training and plans for organizers and security contact (recent wildfires makes me ask this)
•	Parking options and discounts possibility?
