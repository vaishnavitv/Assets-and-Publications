I started a new Google Developer Group in Burnaby.
Hope to collab with you for some virtual/in person events or give me a hand at volunteering. Could you join the group please :)

About GDG : When you join a Google Developer Group, you'll have the opportunity to learn new skills in a variety of formats. Youâ€™ll also meet local developers virtually or in-person with similar interests in technology. The community prides itself on being an inclusive environment where everyone and anyone interested in tech - from beginner developers to experienced professionals are welcome to join.
Looking forward to your support.
